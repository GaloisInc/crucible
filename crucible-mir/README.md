# crucible-mir

This package implements a MIR frontend for Crucible. This exports all of the
code that is useful across multiple projects that make use of MIR, such as
[`crux-mir`](https://github.com/GaloisInc/crucible/blob/master/crux-mir) and
[`crux-mir-comp`](https://github.com/GaloisInc/saw-script/blob/master/crux-mir-comp).
