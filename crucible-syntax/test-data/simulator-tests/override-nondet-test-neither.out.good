Assuming:
* in main test-data/simulator-tests/override-nondet-test-neither.cbl:6:5: w is not 0 or 1
    and (not (eq 0 cw@0:i)) (not (eq 1 cw@0:i))
* The branch in main from test-data/simulator-tests/override-nondet-test-neither.cbl:7:12 to after branch 0
    not (and (eq 0 cw@0:i) (eq 0 cnondetBranchesZ@12:i))
* The branch in nondetBranchesTest from after branch 0 to after branch 1
    not (and (eq 1 cw@0:i) (eq 1 cnondetBranchesZ@12:i))
* The branch in nondetBranchesTest from after branch 1 to default branch
    let -- test-data/simulator-tests/override-nondet-test-neither.cbl:7:12
        v17 = eq 2 cnondetBranchesZ@12:i
     in and (not (eq 0 cw@0:i)) (not (eq 1 cw@0:i)) v17
Prove:
  default branch: error: in nondetBranchesTest
  fall-through branch
  false
