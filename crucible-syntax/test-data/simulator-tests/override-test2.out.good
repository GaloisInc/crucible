Assuming:
* The branch in main from test-data/simulator-tests/override-test2.cbl:5:12 to after branch 0
    not (eq 1 cx@0:i)
* The branch in symbolicBranchesTest from after branch 0 to after branch 1
    not (eq 2 cx@0:i)
* The branch in symbolicBranchesTest from after branch 1 to after branch 2
    not (eq 3 cx@0:i)
Prove:
  default branch: error: in symbolicBranchesTest
  fall-through branch
  false
COUNTEREXAMPLE
Assuming:
* The branch in symbolicBranchesTest from after branch 1 to third branch
    let -- default branch
        v26 = and (not (eq 1 cx@0:i)) (not (eq 2 cx@0:i)) (not (eq 3 cx@0:i))
     in not v26
Prove:
  test-data/simulator-tests/override-test2.cbl:6:5: error: in main
  bogus!
  let -- default branch
      v19 = intSum (intMul 2 cx@0:i) (ite (eq 2 cx@0:i) 0 cy@1:i)
