Assuming:
* The branch in main from test-data/simulator-tests/override-test2.cbl:5:12 to after branch 0
    boolNot (intEq 1 cx@2:i)
* The branch in symbolicBranchesTest from after branch 0 to after branch 1
    boolNot (intEq 2 cx@2:i)
* The branch in symbolicBranchesTest from after branch 1 to after branch 2
    boolNot (intEq 3 cx@2:i)
Prove:
  fall-through branch
  in symbolicBranchesTest at default branch
  false
COUNTEREXAMPLE
Assuming:
* The branch in symbolicBranchesTest from after branch 1 to third branch
    let -- default branch
        v27 = boolAnd (boolNot (intEq 3 cx@2:i)) (boolNot (intEq 2 cx@2:i))
     in boolNot (boolAnd v27 (boolNot (intEq 1 cx@2:i)))
Prove:
  bogus!
  in main at test-data/simulator-tests/override-test2.cbl:6:5
  let -- default branch
      v23 = intSum 2* cx@2:i (intIte (intEq 2 cx@2:i) 0 cy@3:i)
