Assuming:
* in main test-data/simulator-tests/assume-merge2.cbl:9:5: odd
    not (and (not (eq 1 (intMod cx@0:i 2))) (not (intLe 0 cx@0:i)))
* in main test-data/simulator-tests/assume-merge2.cbl:6:5: even
    not (and (intLe 0 cx@0:i) (not (eq 0 (intMod cx@0:i 2))))
Prove:
  oopsie!
  in main at test-data/simulator-tests/assume-merge2.cbl:12:5
  false
