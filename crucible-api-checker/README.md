# Crucible Api Usage Checker
This is a first approximation of an NFA based api usage checker in Crucible. It is implemented as a Crucible execution feature and currently specialized to the LLVM front end. As there is not yet a front end NFA api specification language, there are 2 example NFAs hardcoded withing the source file. One example checkes for proper function call ordering and the other checks that a function is passed in the return value (`LLVMPointer`) of a previous function. Which NFA is loaded can be configured within the source file. To demo the functionality, install the `apiCheckExecFeat` execution feature in `Crux` (`Crux.hs`) and then use `CruxLLVMMain.hs` on the provided cpp demo files in `/test`
