Integration tests for SAWScript
===============================

Running tests
=============

To run all default tests:
    ./runtests.sh

The default tests are those with directory names of the form "test*"
which are not listed in the file defined by the environment variable
"DISABLED_TESTS". The default value of "DISABLED_TESTS" is
"disabled_tests.txt". Non-default tests can always be run manually, as
in the next example.

To run a subset of tests, provide the directory names you wish to run:
    ./runtests.sh test0001 test0029

Output from test runs will be placed in the logs/ directory.

The "runtests.sh" script expects to find the generated executables
(for, e.g., saw) in "../SAWScript/build/bin".  A different directory
can be specified by defining the "BIN" environment variable.

By default tests are run with a timeout of 5 minutes. The default
timeout can be overridden by defining the timeout in seconds in the
TEST_TIMEOUT environment variable. For example, to run the default
tests with a timeout of 30 minutes:

  (TEST_TIMEOUT=1800; ./runtests.sh)

Creating tests
==============

A test is defined by a directory which contains a shell script called
"test.sh"; the test succeeds when the shell script does. When run by
"runtests.sh", these "test.sh" scripts are interpreted by "sh", which
varies with platform -- in particular, it's not Bash on Debian based
systems. So, keep your "test.sh" simple, or change how "runtests.sh"
works.

Tests generally consist of a SAW script that is expected to succeed
together with the artifacts that are needed. The "runtests.sh" script
defines environment variables "JAVA", "SAW", "LSS", and "JSS",
pointing to the corresponding executables, and with appropriate Java
classpaths included. It's a good idea to include a README in each test
directory.

If the test directory name starts with "test", and the directory name
is not included in the file specified by the environment variable
"DISABLED_TESTS", then the test is run by default. Only default tests
are run on the build slaves. When disabling a test by default, explain
why in that test's README.
