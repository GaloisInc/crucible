Test AIG generation in JSS using SAW backend.

The tests in 'test.saw' only make sense for the SAW backend; the
default backend encodes the arguments and results in a different
way.

There used to be a bug in JSS and LSS where multiple AIG writes
interacted, causing the number of input bits in the AIG to grow with
each write. So in 'test.sh' we are careful to check that the number of
input bits is always 16.

Besides checking predicates, where the input encoding does not matter,
and the output is a single bit, we also check the input and output
encoding for functions. Here there are some surprises if you don't
know that Java bytes get promoted to ints in arithmetic, so that
e.g. 'x + x' has type 'int' and is the same as '((int) x) + ((int) x)'
for 'x' of type 'byte'. This is covered in the Binary Numeric
Promotion section of the Java spec:
