## Why dlmalloc?

This crate is a port of [dlmalloc] to Rust, and doesn't rely on C. The primary
purpose of this crate is to serve as the default allocator for Rust on the
`wasm32-unknown-unknown` target. At the time this was written the wasm target
didn't support C code, so it was required to have a Rust-only solution.

This allocator is not the most performant by a longshot. It is primarily, I
think, intended for being easy to port and easy to learn. I didn't dive too deep
into the implementation when writing it, it's just a straight port of the C
version.

It's unlikely that Rust code needs to worry/interact with this allocator in
general. Most of the time you'll be manually switching to a different allocator
:)
