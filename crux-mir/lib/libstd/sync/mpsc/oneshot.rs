/// Oneshot channels/ports
///
/// This is the initial flavor of channels/ports used for comm module. This is
/// an optimization for the one-use case of a channel. The major optimization of
/// this type is to have one and exactly one allocation when the chan/port pair
/// is created.
///
/// Another possible optimization would be to not use an Arc box because
/// in theory we know when the shared packet can be deallocated (no real need
/// for the atomic reference counting), but I was having trouble how to destroy
/// the data early in a drop of a Port.
///
/// # Implementation
///
/// Oneshots are implemented around one atomic usize variable. This variable
/// indicates both the state of the port/chan but also contains any threads
/// blocked on the port. All atomic operations happen on this one word.
///
/// In order to upgrade a oneshot channel, an upgrade is considered a disconnect
/// on behalf of the channel side of things (it can be mentally thought of as
/// consuming the port). This upgrade is then also stored in the shared packet.
/// The one caveat to consider is that when a port sees a disconnected channel
/// it must check for data because there is no "data plus upgrade" state.
