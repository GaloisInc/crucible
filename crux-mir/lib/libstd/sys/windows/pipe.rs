/// The ours/theirs pipes are *not* specifically readable or writable. Each
/// one only supports a read or a write, but which is which depends on the
/// boolean flag given. If `ours_readable` is `true`, then `ours` is readable and
/// `theirs` is writable. Conversely, if `ours_readable` is `false`, then `ours`
/// is writable and `theirs` is readable.
///
/// Also note that the `ours` pipe is always a handle opened up in overlapped
/// mode. This means that technically speaking it should only ever be used
/// with `OVERLAPPED` instances, but also works out ok if it's only ever used
/// once at a time (which we do indeed guarantee).
