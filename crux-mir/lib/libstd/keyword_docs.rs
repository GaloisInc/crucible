//
/// Cast between types, or rename an import.
///
/// `as` is most commonly used to turn primitive types into other primitive types, but it has other
/// uses that include turning pointers into addresses, addresses into pointers, and pointers into
/// other pointers.
///
/// ```rust
/// let thing1: u8 = 89.0 as u8;
/// assert_eq!('B' as u32, 66);
/// assert_eq!(thing1 as char, 'Y');
/// let thing2: f32 = thing1 as f32 + 10.5;
/// assert_eq!(true as u8 + thing2 as u8, 100);
/// ```
///
/// In general, any cast that can be performed via ascribing the type can also be done using `as`,
/// so instead of writing `let x: u32 = 123`, you can write `let x = 123 as u32` (Note: `let x: u32
/// = 123` would be best in that situation). The same is not true in the other direction, however,
/// explicitly using `as` allows a few more coercions that aren't allowed implicitly, such as
/// changing the type of a raw pointer or turning closures into raw pointers.
///
/// Other places `as` is used include as extra syntax for [`crate`] and `use`, to change the name
/// something is imported as.

///
/// Sometimes a certain value is used many times throughout a program, and it can become
/// inconvenient to copy it over and over. What's more, it's not always possible or desirable to
/// make it a variable that gets carried around to each function that needs it. In these cases, the
/// `const` keyword provides a convenient alternative to code duplication.
///
/// ```rust
/// const THING: u32 = 0xABAD1DEA;
///
/// let foo = 123 + THING;
/// ```
///
/// Constants must be explicitly typed, unlike with `let` you can't ignore its type and let the
/// compiler figure it out. Any constant value can be defined in a const, which in practice happens
/// to be most things that would be reasonable to have a constant (barring `const fn`s). For
/// example, you can't have a File as a `const`.
///
/// The only lifetime allowed in a constant is `'static`, which is the lifetime that encompasses
/// all others in a Rust program. For example, if you wanted to define a constant string, it would
/// look like this:
///
/// ```rust
/// const WORDS: &str = "hello rust!";
/// ```
///
/// Thanks to static lifetime elision, you usually don't have to explicitly use 'static:
///
/// ```rust
/// const WORDS: &str = "hello convenience!";
/// ```
///
/// `const` items looks remarkably similar to `static` items, which introduces some confusion as
/// to which one should be used at which times. To put it simply, constants are inlined wherever
/// they're used, making using them identical to simply replacing the name of the const with its
/// value. Static variables on the other hand point to a single location in memory, which all
/// accesses share. This means that, unlike with constants, they can't have destructors, and act as
/// a single value across the entire codebase.
///
/// Constants, as with statics, should always be in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE.

///
/// In addition to presenting fixed types in the form of `fn name(arg: type, ..) -> return_type`,

#[doc(keyword = "struct")]
//
/// A type that is composed of other types.
///
/// Structs in Rust come in three flavors: Structs with named fields, tuple structs, and unit
/// structs.
///
/// ```rust
/// struct Regular {
///     field1: f32,
///     field2: String,
///     pub field3: bool
/// }
///
/// struct Tuple(u32, String);
///
/// struct Unit;
/// ```
///
/// Regular structs are the most commonly used. Each field defined within them has a name and a
/// type, and once defined can be accessed using `example_struct.field` syntax. The fields of a
/// struct share its mutability, so `foo.bar = 2;` would only be valid if `foo` was mutable. Adding
/// `pub` to a field makes it visible to code in other modules, as well as allowing it to be
/// directly accessed and modified.
///
/// Tuple structs are similar to regular structs, but its fields have no names. They are used like
/// tuples, with deconstruction possible via `let TupleStruct(x, y) = foo;` syntax. For accessing
/// individual variables, the same syntax is used as with regular tuples, namely `foo.0`, `foo.1`,
/// etc, starting at zero.
///
/// Unit structs are most commonly used as marker. They have a size of zero bytes, but unlike empty
/// enums they can be instantiated, making them isomorphic to the unit type `()`. Unit structs are
/// useful when you need to implement a trait on something, but don't need to store any data inside
/// it.
///
/// # Instantiation
///
/// Structs can be instantiated in different ways, all of which can be mixed and
/// matched as needed. The most common way to make a new struct is via a constructor method such as
/// `new()`, but when that isn't available (or you're writing the constructor itself), struct
/// literal syntax is used:
///
/// ```rust
/// # struct Foo { field1: f32, field2: String, etc: bool }
/// let example = Foo {
///     field1: 42.0,
///     field2: "blah".to_string(),
///     etc: true,
/// };
/// ```
///
/// It's only possible to directly instantiate a struct using struct literal syntax when all of its
/// fields are visible to you.
///
/// There are a handful of shortcuts provided to make writing constructors more convenient, most
/// common of which is the Field Init shorthand. When there is a variable and a field of the same
/// name, the assignment can be simplified from `field: field` into simply `field`. The following
/// example of a hypothetical constructor demonstrates this:
///
/// ```rust
/// struct User {
///     name: String,
///     admin: bool,
/// }
///
/// impl User {
///     pub fn new(name: String) -> Self {
///         Self {
///             name,
///             admin: false,
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Another shortcut for struct instantiation is available, used when you need to make a new
/// struct that has the same values as most of a previous struct of the same type, called struct
/// update syntax:
///
/// ```rust
/// # struct Foo { field1: String, field2: () }
/// # let thing = Foo { field1: "".to_string(), field2: () };
/// let updated_thing = Foo {
///     field1: "a new value".to_string(),
///     ..thing
/// };
/// ```
///
/// Tuple structs are instantiated in the same way as tuples themselves, except with the struct's
/// name as a prefix: `Foo(123, false, 0.1)`.
///
/// Empty structs are instantiated with just their name, and don't need anything else. `let thing =
/// EmptyStruct;`
///
/// # Style conventions
///
/// Structs are always written in CamelCase, with few exceptions. While the trailing comma on a
/// struct's list of fields can be omitted, it's usually kept for convenience in adding and
/// removing fields down the line.
///
/// For more information on structs, take a look at the [Rust Book][book] or the
/// [Reference][reference].
