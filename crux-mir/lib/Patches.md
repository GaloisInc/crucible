# Patching the Rust standard library

This directory bundles a copy of the Rust standard library with various patches
applied in certain key places to make the resulting code easier for Crucible to
handle. These patches must be applied every time that the bundled Rust standard
library is updated. Moreover, this code often looks quite different each time
between Rust versions, so applying the patches is rarely as straightforward as
running `git apply`.

As a compromise, this document contains high-level descriptions of each type of
patch that we apply, along with rationale for why the patch is necessary. The
intent is that this document can be used in conjunction with `git blame` to
identify all of the code that was changed in each patch.

* Use Crucible's allocator in `alloc/src/raw_vec.rs` (last applied: April 14, 2023)

  The `Allocator` for `RawVec`s is quite involved and is beyond Crucible's
  ability to reason about. We replace the `Allocator` with the corresponding
  built-in Crucible allocation functions (e.g., `crucible::alloc::allocate`).
  We also make sure to avoid the `Layout::array` function, which has a
  particularly tricky use of `transmute` that we do not currently support.

* Use crucible's allocator instead of `rustc_box` (last applied: May 17, 2023)

  Same reasoning as above.

* Reimplement `core::fmt` using `crucible::any::Any` (last applied: May 2, 2023)

  This avoids some particularly nasty `transmute`s.

* Implement `HashMap` in terms of `Vec` (last applied: May 4, 2023)

  The actual implementation (in terms of `hashbrown`) is too complicated for
  Crucible to handle efficiently.

* Implement `ptr::invalid` and `ptr::invalid_mut` in terms of casts instead of
  `transmute` (last applied: May 9, 2023)

  The uses of `transmute` in these two functions are particularly nasty, so we
  choose a simpler implementation in terms of casts instead. These uses of
  `transmute` are meant to support strict provenance for Rust pointers, but we
  ignore this in `crucible-mir`.

* Avoid pointer arithmetic in slice iterators (last applied: May 9, 2023)

  Upstream slice::Iter has `ptr` and `end` fields, and computes the length
  by subtracting the two.  This is difficult for us to support at the
  moment.  We can compute the difference between two pointers into the
  same array, but we don't have a good way to decide whether two
  `Const_RefRoot`s are "the same object" or not.  (We could assign them a
  `Nonce` for identity, but since the point of `Const_RefRoot` is to
  support muxing, we'd have to mux the nonces, which makes things much
  more complicated.  And we can't simply declare that all `Const_RefRoot`s
  containing the same value are the same object, because we don't have a
  generic equality test that covers all crucible types.)  This commit adds
  a simple workaround: include an explicit `len` field, which is updated
  in sync with `ptr` and `end`, and avoids the need for pointer
  arithmetic.

* Implement `str::as_bytes` via `crucible_identity_transmute` (last applied: May 16, 2023)

  This is necessary to avoid a gnarly use of `transmute`.

* Don't deallocate in `box_free` and `drop` (last applied: May 17, 2023)

  Crucible doesn't support a `deallocate` operation.

* Reimplement `from_{le,be}_bytes` (last applied: May 18, 2023)

  The actual implementations of these functions involve gnarly uses of
  `transmute`.

* Reimplement `to_{le,be}_bytes` (last applied: May 18, 2023)

  Same reasoning as above.

* Use `allocate_zeroed` in `RawVec`'s `allocate_in` (last applied: May 24, 2023)

  This is needed to make `vec![0; len]` work as expected.

* Use `crucible_slice_len_hook` when computing slice `len` (last applied: May 26, 2023)

  The usual implementation of slice length requires using the `PtrRepr` union
  type. Currently, `crucible-mir` does not support Rust unions, so we instead
  implement slice `len` in terms of our own `crucible_slice_len_hook` function
  that we override.

* Use `crucible_array_from_slice_hook` in `&[T] -> &[T; N]` `TryFrom` impl (last applied: May 26, 2023)

  The actual implementation uses a pointer cast that Crucible can't handle.

* Disable `IsRawEqComparable`-based `SpecArrayEq` instances (last applied: May 26, 2023)

  These require pointer casts that Crucible can't support. We instead fall back
  on the other `SpecArrayEq` instances that are slower (but easier to
  translate).

* Disable bytewise equality comparisons for `[T]` (last applied: May 26, 2023)

  These require the `size_of_val` intrinsic, which isn't current supported.

* Use `crucible_null_hook` to implement `null`/`null_mut` (last applied: May 30, 2023)

  Morally, the `null`/`null_mut` functions behave like `0 as *const`/`0 as
  *mut`, but due to Strict Pointer Provenance, their actual implementations are
  much trickier than that. Unfortunately, we can't just inline `0 as *const`/`0
  as *mut`, as recent versions of `rustc` won't typecheck that.  We resort to
  overriding custom `crucible_null_hook` functions instead.

* Implement `Demand` using `PhantomData` instead of a dynamically sized `dyn` (last applied: June 1, 2023)

  We do not current support dynamically sized types in crucible-mir.

* Replace `sys::time` with Crux-specific implementation (last applied: June 1, 2023)

  Crux's version is not suitable for doing actual timing (it hard-codes the
  time to a fixed date), but it does simulate much more easily than the actual
  implementation.

* Replace `sys::{condvar,mutex,rwlock}` with Crux-specific implementation (last applied: June 1, 2023)

  Because Crucible is effectively single-threaded, we can safely replace these
  with much simpler implementations that aren't nearly as tricky to simulate.

* Use Crucible-friendly implementations of `byteorder` functions (last applied: June 2, 2023)

  Much of `byteorder` is implemented on top of unsafe code that is tricky to
  simulate.
