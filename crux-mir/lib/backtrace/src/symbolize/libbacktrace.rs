//! Symbolication strategy using the DWARF-parsing code in libbacktrace.
//!
//! The libbacktrace C library, typically distributed with gcc, supports not
//! only generating a backtrace (which we don't actually use) but also
//! symbolicating the backtrace and handling dwarf debug information about
//! things like inlined frames and whatnot.
//!
//! This is relatively complicated due to lots of various concerns here, but the
//! basic idea is:
//!
//! * First we call `backtrace_syminfo`. This gets symbol information from the
//!   dynamic symbol table if we can.
//! * Next we call `backtrace_pcinfo`. This will parse debuginfo tables if
//!   they're available and allow us to recover information about inline frames,
//!   filenames, line numbers, etc.
//!
//! There's lots of trickery about getting the dwarf tables into libbacktrace,
//! but hopefully it's not the end of the world and is clear enough when reading
//! below.
//!
//! This is the default symbolication strategy for non-MSVC and non-OSX
//! platforms. In libstd though this is the default strategy for OSX.
