# Each feature controls the two phases of finding a backtrace: getting a
# backtrace and then resolving instruction pointers to symbols. The default
# feature enables all the necessary features for each platform this library
# supports, but it can be disabled to have finer grained control over the
# dependencies.
#
# Note that not all features are available on all platforms, so even though a
# feature is enabled some other feature may be used instead.

#=======================================
# Methods of acquiring a backtrace
#
# - libunwind: when using this the libgcc library is linked against to get
#   the unwinding support. This is generally the most reliable method to get
#   a backtrace on unix.
# - unix-backtrace: this uses the backtrace(3) function to acquire a
#   backtrace, but is not as reliable as libunwind. It is, however,
#   generally found in more locations.
# - dbghelp: on windows this enables usage of dbghelp.dll to find a
#   backtrace at runtime
# - kernel32: on windows this enables using RtlCaptureStackBackTrace as the
#   function to acquire a backtrace
libunwind = []
unix-backtrace = []
dbghelp = []
kernel32 = []

#=======================================
# Methods of resolving symbols
#
# - libbacktrace: this feature activates the `backtrace-sys` dependency,
#   building the libbacktrace library found in gcc repos. This library
#   parses the DWARF info of ELF executables to find symbol names, and it
#   can also provide filename/line number information if debuginfo is
#   compiled in. This library currently only primarily works on unixes that
#   are not OSX, however.
# - dladdr: this feature uses the dladdr(3) function (a glibc extension) to
#   resolve symbol names. This is fairly unreliable on linux, but works well
#   enough on OSX.
# - coresymbolication: this feature uses the undocumented core symbolication
#   framework on OS X to symbolize. Note that this is not turned on default due
#   to various issues, you can see more in #202.
# - gimli-symbolize: use the `gimli-rs/addr2line` crate to symbolicate
#   addresses into file, line, and name using DWARF debug information. At
#   the moment, this is only possible when targetting Linux, since macOS
#   splits DWARF out into a separate object file. Enabling this feature
#   means one less C dependency.
