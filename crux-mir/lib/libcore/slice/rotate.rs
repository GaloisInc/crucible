/// Rotates the range `[mid-left, mid+right)` such that the element at `mid`

/// # Safety
///
/// The specified range must be valid for reading and writing.
///
/// # Algorithm
///
/// For longer rotations, swap the left-most `delta = min(left, right)`
/// elements with the right-most `delta` elements. LLVM vectorizes this,
/// which is profitable as we only reach this step for a "large enough"
/// rotation. Doing this puts `delta` elements on the larger side into the
/// correct position, leaving a smaller rotate problem. Demonstration:
///
/// ```text
/// [ 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 . 1 2 3 4 5 ]
/// 1 2 3 4 5 [ 11 12 13 . 6 7 8 9 10 ]
/// 1 2 3 4 5 [ 8 9 10 . 6 7 ] 11 12 13
/// 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 [ 10 . 8 9 ] 11 12 13
/// 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 [ 9 . 8 ] 10 11 12 13
/// 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 [ . ] 9 10 11 12 13
/// ```
///
/// Once the rotation is small enough, copy some elements into a stack
/// buffer, `memmove` the others, and move the ones back from the buffer.
