/// A wrapper to inhibit compiler from automatically calling `T`’s destructor.
///
/// This wrapper is 0-cost.
///
/// `ManuallyDrop<T>` is subject to the same layout optimizations as `T`.
/// As a consequence, it has *no effect* on the assumptions that the compiler makes
/// about all values being initialized at their type.  In particular, initializing
/// a `ManuallyDrop<&mut T>` with [`mem::zeroed`] is undefined behavior.
/// If you need to handle uninitialized data, use [`MaybeUninit<T>`] instead.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// This wrapper helps with explicitly documenting the drop order dependencies between fields of
/// the type:
///
/// ```rust
/// use std::mem::ManuallyDrop;
/// struct Peach;
/// struct Banana;
/// struct Melon;
/// struct FruitBox {
///     // Immediately clear there’s something non-trivial going on with these fields.
///     peach: ManuallyDrop<Peach>,
///     melon: Melon, // Field that’s independent of the other two.
///     banana: ManuallyDrop<Banana>,
/// }
///
/// impl Drop for FruitBox {
///     fn drop(&mut self) {
///         unsafe {
///             // Explicit ordering in which field destructors are run specified in the intuitive
///             // location – the destructor of the structure containing the fields.
///             // Moreover, one can now reorder fields within the struct however much they want.
///             ManuallyDrop::drop(&mut self.peach);
///             ManuallyDrop::drop(&mut self.banana);
///         }
///         // After destructor for `FruitBox` runs (this function), the destructor for Melon gets
///         // invoked in the usual manner, as it is not wrapped in `ManuallyDrop`.
///     }
/// }
