//! Manually manage memory through raw pointers.
//!
//! *[See also the pointer primitive types](../../std/primitive.pointer.html).*
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! Many functions in this module take raw pointers as arguments and read from
//! or write to them. For this to be safe, these pointers must be *valid*.
//! Whether a pointer is valid depends on the operation it is used for
//! (read or write), and the extent of the memory that is accessed (i.e.,
//! how many bytes are read/written). Most functions use `*mut T` and `*const T`
//! to access only a single value, in which case the documentation omits the size
//! and implicitly assumes it to be `size_of::<T>()` bytes.
//!
//! The precise rules for validity are not determined yet. The guarantees that are
//! provided at this point are very minimal:
//!
//! * A [null] pointer is *never* valid, not even for accesses of [size zero][zst].
//! * All pointers (except for the null pointer) are valid for all operations of
//!   [size zero][zst].
//! * All accesses performed by functions in this module are *non-atomic* in the sense
//!   of [atomic operations] used to synchronize between threads. This means it is
//!   undefined behavior to perform two concurrent accesses to the same location from different
//!   threads unless both accesses only read from memory. Notice that this explicitly
//!   includes [`read_volatile`] and [`write_volatile`]: Volatile accesses cannot
//!   be used for inter-thread synchronization.
//! * The result of casting a reference to a pointer is valid for as long as the
//!   underlying object is live and no reference (just raw pointers) is used to
//!   access the same memory.
//!
//! These axioms, along with careful use of [`offset`] for pointer arithmetic,
//! are enough to correctly implement many useful things in unsafe code. Stronger guarantees
//! will be provided eventually, as the [aliasing] rules are being determined. For more
//! information, see the [book] as well as the section in the reference devoted
//! to [undefined behavior][ub].
//!
//! ## Alignment
//!
//! Valid raw pointers as defined above are not necessarily properly aligned (where
//! "proper" alignment is defined by the pointee type, i.e., `*const T` must be
//! aligned to `mem::align_of::<T>()`). However, most functions require their
//! arguments to be properly aligned, and will explicitly state
//! this requirement in their documentation. Notable exceptions to this are
//! [`read_unaligned`] and [`write_unaligned`].
//!
//! When a function requires proper alignment, it does so even if the access
//! has size 0, i.e., even if memory is not actually touched. Consider using
//! [`NonNull::dangling`] in such cases.
