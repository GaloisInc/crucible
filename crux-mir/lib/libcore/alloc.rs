/// * the memory block has not been subsequently deallocated, where
///   blocks are deallocated either by being passed to a deallocation
///   method (`dealloc`, `dealloc_one`, `dealloc_array`) or by being
///   passed to a reallocation method (see above) that returns `Ok`.
///
/// A note regarding zero-sized types and zero-sized layouts: many
/// methods in the `Alloc` trait state that allocation requests
/// must be non-zero size, or else undefined behavior can result.
///
/// * However, some higher-level allocation methods (`alloc_one`,
///   `alloc_array`) are well-defined on zero-sized types and can
///   optionally support them: it is left up to the implementor
///   whether to return `Err`, or to return `Ok` with some pointer.
///
/// * If an `Alloc` implementation chooses to return `Ok` in this
///   case (i.e., the pointer denotes a zero-sized inaccessible block)
///   then that returned pointer must be considered "currently
///   allocated". On such an allocator, *all* methods that take
///   currently-allocated pointers as inputs must accept these
///   zero-sized pointers, *without* causing undefined behavior.
///
/// * In other words, if a zero-sized pointer can flow out of an
///   allocator, then that allocator must likewise accept that pointer
///   flowing back into its deallocation and reallocation methods.
///
/// Some of the methods require that a layout *fit* a memory block.
/// What it means for a layout to "fit" a memory block means (or
/// equivalently, for a memory block to "fit" a layout) is that the
/// following two conditions must hold:
///
/// 1. The block's starting address must be aligned to `layout.align()`.
///
/// 2. The block's size must fall in the range `[use_min, use_max]`, where:
///
///    * `use_min` is `self.usable_size(layout).0`, and
///
///    * `use_max` is the capacity that was (or would have been)
///      returned when (if) the block was allocated via a call to
///      `alloc_excess` or `realloc_excess`.
///
/// Note that:
///
///  * the size of the layout most recently used to allocate the block
///    is guaranteed to be in the range `[use_min, use_max]`, and
///
///  * a lower-bound on `use_max` can be safely approximated by a call to
///    `usable_size`.
///
///  * if a layout `k` fits a memory block (denoted by `ptr`)
///    currently allocated via an allocator `a`, then it is legal to
///    use that layout to deallocate it, i.e., `a.dealloc(ptr, k);`.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// The `Alloc` trait is an `unsafe` trait for a number of reasons, and
/// implementors must ensure that they adhere to these contracts:
///
/// * Pointers returned from allocation functions must point to valid memory and
///   retain their validity until at least the instance of `Alloc` is dropped
///   itself.
///
/// * `Layout` queries and calculations in general must be correct. Callers of
///   this trait are allowed to rely on the contracts defined on each method,
///   and implementors must ensure such contracts remain true.
