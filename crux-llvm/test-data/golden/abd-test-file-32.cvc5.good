SKIP_TEST

This test is disabled because it takes an extraordinarily long time to complete
with `cvc5-1.2.0` or later (as reported upstream in
https://github.com/cvc5/cvc5/issues/12234).

TODO(#1635): Re-enable this test once the upstream issue has been fixed and is
available in a what4-solvers release.
