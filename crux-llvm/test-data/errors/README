This directory contains a collection of programs that are expected to
fail in various ways when they are attempted to be verified using
crux-llvm, and ensure that they report reasonable error messages
and such.  Some of them require particular settings from crux
to exhibit the desired errors (e.g., specialfloats.c will only
exhibit all the intended errors when in IEEE754 floating-point mode).

I'm not 100% what's the best way to arrange these into
a test suite, but I've done a fair amount of useful work to collect
them together, so I wanted to go ahead and get them into the
repository here. -- RWD
