This module provides managament support for keeping track
of a context of logical assumptions.  The API provided here
is similar to the interactive mode of an SMT solver.  Logical
conditions can be assumed into the current context, and bundles
of assumptions are organized into frames which are pushed and
popped by the user to manage the state.

Additionally, proof goals can be asserted to the system.  These will be
turned into complete logical statements by assuming the current context
and be stashed in a collection of remembered goals for later dispatch to
solvers.
