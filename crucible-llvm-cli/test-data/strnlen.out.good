Assuming:
* The branch in main at test-data/strnlen.cbl:34:14
    not (eq 0x0:[8] cf@32:bv)
* in main test-data/strnlen.cbl:45:5: g != 0
    not (eq 0x0:[8] cg@77:bv)
Prove:
  test-data/strnlen.cbl:51:5: error: in main
  strnlen(..., 3) when first 3 bytes non-null is 3
  not (eq 0x0:[8] cg@77:bv)
PROVED
